  abstract = {Zusammenfassung. Eines der ersten validierten Instrumente zur wissenschaftlichen Untersuchung von Emotionsregulationsprozessen, stellt der englischsprachige Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) von Gross und John (2003) dar. Dieser erlaubt es, Präferenzen für zwei häufig angewandte Strategien zur Emotionsregulation, nämlich Unterdrückung (suppression) und Neubewertung (reappraisal) zu erfassen. Die deutsche Version wurde in drei Übersetzungsschritten an jeweils einer Gruppe von Studenten (n = 113/167/174) erprobt. Dabei stand eine möglichst enge Orientierung am englischen Original sowie die Optimierung der Faktoren-Ladungen auf die zwei Komponenten im Vordergrund. Eine Faktorenanalyse mit iterativer Kommunalitätenschätzung und Varimax-Rotation wurde verwendet. Entsprechend unserem Ziel erreichten die Alpha-Werte (innere Konsistenz) als Reliabilitätsmaß für Unterdrückung und Neubewertung die Durchschnittswerte des amerikanischen Originalfragebogens. Wir entwickelten ein Instrument, das einfach und in kurzer Zeit (5–10 min) zu beantworten ist und differenziert die beiden Emotionsregulationsstile Neubewertung und Suppression erfasst. Mögliche Anwendungsbereiche sind die Untersuchung von Depressionen und Angsterkrankungen und die Bewertung psychotherapeutischer Verfahren.},

  abstract = {The present study tested a possible explanation for the positive relationship between the motivation to engage in cognitive endeavors (need for cognition, NFC) and indicators of affective adjustment (e.g., higher self-esteem, lower depression) that has been demonstrated in previous studies. We suggest that dispositional self-control capacity mediates this relationship, since NFC has been found to be related to self-control capacity, and self-control capacity is crucial for adjustment. NFC, dispositional self-control capacity, self-esteem, habitual depressive mood, and tendency to respond in a socially desirable manner were measured among 150 university students via self-report. Regression analyses and Sobel tests revealed that self-control capacity was a potential mediator of the positive relationship between NFC and affective adjustment. The findings were robust in terms of social desirability.},

Die in der Gesamtskala enthaltene Kurzskala aus 13 Items erwies sich in beiden Studien als eindimensional, reliabel und valide bezüglich erwarteter Zusammenhänge mit Kriteriumsvariablen. Der Vergleich zwischen Kurz- und Gesamtskala zeigte, dass die Kosten der ökonomischeren Messung hinsichtlich Reliabilität und Validität gering sind.},

Structural equation modeling was used to identify significant pathways between exogenous variables of conscientiousness, openness, and education to need for cognition, and between neuroticism and health to perceived control. Need for cognition and perceived control emerged as separate and distinct forms of motivation, contributing to positive and negative affect in this model through differing patterns and to different degrees. Mediators between need for cognition and positive affect were frequency of cognitive activity and problem-focus coping. Perceived control had direct effects on positive and negative affect and indirect effects through cognitive activity on positive affect. The model helps to explain some of the psychological mechanisms instrumental in successful adaptation to change in adulthood. The dispositional motivation of need for cognition is described as a character strength with unique predictive value for older adults.},

Interventions that prevent or slow cognitive decline and encourage positive ageing have potential to produce significant societal benefits and are a rapidly growing enterprise. Currently little is known about how individual difference factors influence adherence to the training regimes and training outcomes. The aim of the present study was to identify the personality and metacognitive beliefs that predict individuals' adherence to a regular training regime and the likelihood that they discontinue training. A sample of 831 older Australians drawn from registered users of a commercial brain training program, performed a range of personality and non-cognitive measures, specifically: need for cognition, implicit theories of intelligence, mastery beliefs, memory self-concept, and big-5 personality factors. The training frequency and performance of participants was tracked over an 18-month period. The results suggest that, within a sample of existing brain trainers, openness to experience, need for cognition, and age predicted training discontinuation. Furthermore, a regression analysis indicated that openness to experience, implicit theories of intelligence, and age influenced game performance. Implications of such findings for the effective design and application of cognitive training for encouraging positive ageing are discussed.},

This is noteworthy given the numerous deficiencies of coefficient alpha documented in the psychometric literature. This mismatch between theory and practice appears to arise partly because users of psychological scales are unfamiliar with the psychometric literature on coefficient alpha and partly because alternatives to alpha are not widely known. We present a brief review of the psychometric literature on coefficient alpha, followed by a practical alternative in the form of coefficient omega. To facilitate the shift from alpha to omega, we also present a brief guide to the calculation of point and interval estimates of omega using a free, open source software environment.},

The path mediation technique recommended by Baron \& Kenny (1986) for testing mediated relationships was also performed in order to assess the causal direction of the NFC and academic self-efficacy variables. Participants were 138 undergraduate students. The first hypothesis was generally supported in that significant correlations were found between NFC, efficacy beliefs, and GPA. In support of the second hypothesis, path analysis revealed that NFC and academic self-efficacy were significant predictors of GPA.

In today's working world, which is characterized by increasing cognitive demands, NFC may contribute to resilience against work-related stress and burnout symptoms. We investigated this question in a large population-wide sample of 4,134 individuals (Study 1) and in a sample of 125 students (Study 2). NFC was consistently negatively related to the burnout facets emotional exhaustion and reduced personal efficacy of the Maslach burnout inventory and explained up to 10\% additional variance in burnout symptoms over and above the five-factor model of personality. In the student sample, where stress factors are mainly cognitive in nature, NFC was the most relevant predictor. In this sample, we additionally investigated whether NFC might be a relevant moderator of the inconsistently found associations between burnout and impairments in cognitive functioning. The participants conducted three cognitive tasks (number-letter task, two-back task, and Go/NoGo task) that measure the executive functions switching, updating, and response inhibition, respectively. While burnout was slightly negatively related to working memory performance, NFC did not moderate the relationship between burnout and executive control which could be traced back to the young and healthy sample used to examine this research question. All in all, our results clearly suggest that NFC may be an important individual difference factor contributing to the resilience against burnout, especially if stress factors are cognitive in nature.},

In both societies, positive correlations with Need for Cognition and Internal Control and negative correlations with external control and obsessive thinking confirmed ISA as an adaptive form of self-consciousness. In partial correlations in which the authors controlled for ISA, SR was associated cross-culturally with greater Obsessive Thinking. This outcome conformed with the authors' expectations that SR would have negative mental health implications, but other data revealed complexities in the SR association with adjustment. Differences between samples failed to yield any simple support for F. Fukuyama's (1992) suggestion that Iranians might be more "alienated" (pp. 236-237) in their psychological functioning. The present study most importantly offered cross-cultural evidence in favor of the claim that better measures of an introspective self-awareness need to be developed.},

  abstract = {Individual differences researchers very commonly report Pearson correlations between their variables of interest. Cohen (1988) provided guidelines for the purposes of interpreting the magnitude of a correlation, as well as estimating power. Specifically, r=0.10, r=0.30, and r=0.50 were recommended to be considered small, medium, and large in magnitude, respectively. However, Cohen's effect size guidelines were based principally upon an essentially qualitative impression, rather than a systematic, quantitative analysis of data. Consequently, the purpose of this investigation was to develop a large sample of previously published meta-analytically derived correlations which would allow for an evaluation of Cohen's guidelines from an empirical perspective. Based on 708 meta-analytically derived correlations, the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles corresponded to correlations of 0.11, 0.19, and 0.29, respectively. Based on the results, it is suggested that Cohen's correlation guidelines are too exigent, as {\textless}3\% of correlations in the literature were found to be as large as r=0.50. Consequently, in the absence of any other information, individual differences researchers are recommended to consider correlations of 0.10, 0.20, and 0.30 as relatively small, typical, and relatively large, in the context of a power analysis, as well as the interpretation of statistical results from a normative perspective.},

Most studies on NFC and related constructs have thereby focused on grades to capture tertiary academic success. This study aimed at a more comprehensive approach on NFC’s meaning to success in university. We examined not only performance but also rather affective indicators of success. The current sample consisted of 396 students of different subjects with a mean age of 24 years (139 male). All participants took part in an online survey that assessed NFC together with school performance and further personality variables via self-report. Success in university was comprehensively operationalized including performance, satisfaction with one’s studies, and thoughts about quitting/changing one’s major as indicators. The value of NFC in predicting tertiary academic success was examined with correlation analyses and path analysis. NFC significantly correlated with all success variables with the highest correlation for study satisfaction. Path analysis confirmed the importance of NFC for study satisfaction showing that NFC had a significant direct effect on study satisfaction and via this variable also a significant indirect effect on termination thoughts. This study clearly indicates that NFC broadly contributes to the mastery of academic requirements and that it is worthwhile to intensify research on NFC in the context of tertiary education.},

Current conceptualizations of stress are challenged as being too phenomenological and ambiguous, and consequently, not given to direct empirical testing. Indeed, it is argued that researchers have tended to avoid the problem of defining stress, choosing to study stress without reference to a clear framework. A new stress model called the model of conservation of resources is presented as an alternative. This resource-oriented model is based on the supposition that people strive to retain, protect, and build resources and that what is threatening to them is the potential or actual loss of these valued resources. Implications of the model of conservation of resources for new research directions are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract   = {BACKGROUND: Increasingly, teenagers and young adults (TYAs) seek out health information online; however, it is not clear whether they possess electronic health (eHealth) literacy, defined as "the ability to select, appraise, and utilize good quality health information from the internet." A number of factors are included in the Lily model proposed by Norman and Skinner underpinning the development of eHealth literacy. It is important to understand which elements may influence the development of eHealth literacy in young people, as the current generation will continue to "Google it" when faced with a health problem throughout their lives.
OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study are to explore potential factors influencing young people's eHealth literacy and explore the underlying constructs of the eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS) in a population of UK university students.
METHODS: A total of 188 undergraduate psychology students from a large UK University were recruited as an opportunity sample. Of these, 88.8\% (167/188) of participants were female with a mean age of 20.13 (SD 2.16) years and the majority were White British (159/188, 84.6\%). Employing a cross-sectional design TYAs completed the following measures exploring eHealth literacy (eHEALS): Irrational Health Belief Scale; Newest Vital Sign (NVS), a measure of functional health literacy; Need for Cognition Scale, a preference for effortful cognitive activity; and General Self-Efficacy (GSE) Scale, exploring personal agency and confidence. The eHEALS was also subject to exploratory factor analysis (EFA), for which in addition to the total variance explained, the scree plot, eigenvalues, and factor loadings were assessed to verify the structure.
RESULTS: eHEALS and GSE were significantly positively correlated (r=0.28, P{\textless}.001) and hierarchical linear modeling revealed GSE as the significant predictor of scores on the eHEALS (F1,186=16.16, P{\textless}.001, R2=0.08), accounting for 8.0\% of the variance. Other notable relationships were GSE and need for cognition (NFC) were also positively correlated (r=0.33, P{\textless}.001), and NFC and irrational health beliefs were significantly negatively correlated (r=-.14, P=.03). Using Spearman correlations, GSE and NVS (rs=0.14, P=.04) and NFC and NVS (rs=0.19, P=.003) were positively correlated. An EFA revealed the scale to be stable and identified a 2-factor structure related to information acquisition and information application.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study in the UK to explore relationships between these key variables and verify the structure of the eHEALS in a TYA population in the UK. The findings that self-efficacy has a major influence firmly consolidate its status as fundamental to the development of eHealth literacy. Future studies will explore the influence of body image and the development of eHealth literacy in more diverse TYA populations.},

  abstract   = {This article examines the adequacy of the “rules of thumb” conventional cutoff criteria and several new alternatives for various fit indexes used to evaluate model fit in practice. Using a 2‐index presentation strategy, which includes using the maximum likelihood (ML)‐based standardized root mean squared residual (SRMR) and supplementing it with either Tucker‐Lewis Index (TLI), Bollen's (1989) Fit Index (BL89), Relative Noncentrality Index (RNI), Comparative Fit Index (CFI), Gamma Hat, McDonald's Centrality Index (Mc), or root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA), various combinations of cutoff values from selected ranges of cutoff criteria for the ML‐based SRMR and a given supplemental fit index were used to calculate rejection rates for various types of true‐population and misspecified models; that is, models with misspecified factor covariance(s) and models with misspecified factor loading(s). The results suggest that, for the ML method, a cutoff value close to .95 for TLI, BL89, CFI, RNI, and Gamma Hat; a cutoff value close to .90 for Mc; a cutoff value close to .08 for SRMR; and a cutoff value close to .06 for RMSEA are needed before we can conclude that there is a relatively good fit between the hypothesized model and the observed data. Furthermore, the 2‐index presentation strategy is required to reject reasonable proportions of various types of true‐population and misspecified models. Finally, using the proposed cutoff criteria, the ML‐based TLI, Mc, and RMSEA tend to overreject true‐population models at small sample size and thus are less preferable when sample size is small.},

A job satisfaction measure was employed for the investigation of the discriminant validity of the burnout measure. Correlations between job satisfaction and the three burnout dimensions were found to be low to moderate. It is suggested that the relationship and the degree of overlap between emotional exhaustion and job satisfaction require further examination. Greek teachers reported lower levels of burnout on the emotional exhaustion and depersonalization scales than teachers in other countries. Finally, younger teachers experienced more emotional exhaustion than older ones and primary education teachers experienced more personal accomplishment and less depersonalization than their counterparts in secondary education.},

The pace of study was assessed by the courses they failed. The statistical analysis used CFA, Cluster Analysis, MANOVA, Discriminant analysis and the Decision tree model. The study suggests the contribution of Sense of Coherence and Need for Cognition to students learning and supports recent suggestions about the crucial role of trait characteristics and mental health in learning. The findings reveal four students’ profiles: (a) surface-unorganized students (b) deep organized students (c) high dissonant students with a low sense of coherence and (d) moderate dissonant students with low need for cognition. In addition, first-year students are most likely to report increased level of failures. The findings are discussed in relation to recent literature.},

Undergraduates estimated the probability that they would experience positive and negative life events and the probability that others would experience the same events. Participants evinced considerable bias in their estimates, expressing the belief that they would experience more desirable and fewer undesirable events than others. Important individual differences in these biases were found. Particularly regarding academic/career events, those with superior intellectual ability expressed more bias than their peers. Surprisingly, even students in the bottom third of intellectual ability displayed considerable academic/career bias. Cognitive style was also linked with the extensiveness of biased perceptions: individuals high in Need for Cognition were more optimistically biased than their peers in the academic/career domain. Also, relative to participants whose cognitive style was more rational, those who relied on intuitive processing believed that both positive and negative events were more likely to be experienced, by both the self and others. Finally, students who eventually dropped out of college were lower in Need for Cognition and had more unrealistic expectations regarding both positive and negative life events than students who remained in school. These findings are discussed in terms of general adolescent phenomena, such as individuation, identity, and the personal fable, and cognitive factors, such as the knowledge of base rate information and the availability heuristic.},

However, the question arises whether this is equally true for all students or whether there are students for whom having adequately challenging schoolwork is even more important than for others. In this study, we investigated whether students' cognitive ability and their need for cognition (i.e., their tendency to actively seek, engage in and enjoy effortful cognitive activity) affects students' motivational responses to adequately challenging schoolwork. Building on data from a large-scale survey among 3002 Flemish 7th graders, we found that adequately challenging schoolwork had a more favorable effect on intrinsic motivation and schoolwork engagement for students high in need for cognition than for students low in need for cognition. Student cognitive ability did not moderate the association between adequate challenge and motivational outcomes. The findings are discussed in light of school engagement and intellectual investment theory.},

This was a cross-sectional analyticalstudy. Two Faculties of Nursing and Midwifery in Shirazand Rafsanjan, Iran. A sample of 337 bachelor’s nursingstudents. Data were collected using a demographic andacademic characteristics questionnaire, Cacioppo and Petty’sNeed for Cognition Scale, Sherer’s General Self-EfficacyScale, and Maslach’s Burnout Inventory-Student Survey.Academic performance was also measured based on students’grade point average. Data analysis was performedvia Pearson correlation analysis, simple and multiple regressionanalyses, and Sobel test equation for mediation effects.Analyses revealed the significant positive correlationof general self-efficacy with the need for cognition andacademic performance as well as the significant inversecorrelation of academic burnout with the need for cognition,general self-efficacy, and academic performance.However, the need for cognition was not significantly correlatedwith academic performance. Moreover, the needfor cognition and general self-efficacy simultaneously predicted16.8\% of the variance of academic burnout, whileonly general self-efficacy was the significant predictor ofacademic performance, accounting for 3.5\% of its totalvariance. General self-efficacy mediated the relationshipof the need for cognition and academic burnout. Also,the need for cognition mediated the relationship of generalself-efficacy and academic burnout (P {\textless} 0.001). Interventionsfor improving students’ self-efficacy and needfor cognition can help reduce their academic burnout andimprove their academic performance.},

However, the effects of NfC on mental adaptation have not been investigated. According to previous studies, it can be hypothesized that NfC decreases maladaptive self-focusing, which is called self-rumination, through increasing effortful control (EC); therefore, we hypothesized that NfC would indirectly inhibit self-rumination through the mediation of EC. As we expected, the results of a cross-sectional questionnaire study with 152 undergraduate participants indicated a negative indirect association between NfC and self-rumination through the mediation of EC. Secondarily, the present results revealed a direct positive association between NfC and adaptive type of self-focusing, which is called self-reflection. The present study is the first to propose the possible contribution of NfC to mental health through decreasing self-rumination and increasing self-reflection.},

Using samples of college students and prison inmates, need for cognition scores were found to be positively associated with measures of self-esteem, masculine sex role attitudes, absorption, and private self-consciousness. Modest negative associations between need for cognition and measures of public self-consciousness and social anxiety were also uncovered. Need for cognition scores were generally unrelated to measures of feminine and androgynous sex role attitudes, shyness, sociability, and loneliness. These findings add further evidence supporting the construct validity of the Need for Cognition Scale and expand our understanding of the construct of need for cognition.},

  abstract   = {Venting—an emotion-focused form of coping involving the discharge of negative feelings to others—is common in organizational settings. Venting may benefit the self via the release of negative emotion, or by acting as a catalyst for changes to problematic work situations. Nonetheless, venting might have unintended consequences via its influence on those who are the recipients of venting from others. In light of this idea, we provide a theoretical explanation for how leaders in particular are affected by venting receipt at work. Drawing from the transactional model of stress, we theorize that venting tends to be appraised as a threat, which triggers negative emotion that, in turn, potentiates deviant action tendencies (i.e., interpersonal mistreatment). Yet, our theory suggests that not all leaders necessarily experience venting in the same way. Specifically, leaders with higher need for cognition are less influenced by surface-level cues associated with others’ emotional expressions and find challenging interpersonal situations to be less aversive, thereby attenuating the deleterious effects of receipt of venting. In an experience sampling study of 112 managers across 10 consecutive workdays, we find support for our theoretical model. Altogether, our findings provide insight into the costs incurred when leaders lend an ear to those who vent, which can result in negative downstream consequences.},

The main objective of this study is to examine - for the first time among employees who sought psychological treatment - the validity of the two most widely used burnout instruments; the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and the Burnout Measure (BM). Two groups were distinguished: a “burned out” group (n = 71) that suffers from work-related neurasthenia (according to ICD-10 criteria), and a “non-burned out” group (n = 68). Results show that: (1) the validity of the three-factor structure of the MBI and the BM is confirmed; (2) burnout can partly be differentiated from other mental syndromes (e.g., anxiety and depression); and (3) two MBI-scales (Emotional Exhaustion and Depersonalization) and one BM-scale (Exhaustion) are able to discriminate between burned out and non-burned out employees. The practical implications of these results are discussed.},

Each chapter features an outline, key concepts, a summary, numerous examples from a variety of disciplines, tables, and figures, including path diagrams, to assist with conceptual understanding. The book first reviews the basics of SEM, data entry/editing, and correlation. Next the authors highlight the basic steps of SEM: model specification, identification, estimation, testing, and modification, followed by issues related to model fit and power and sample size. Chapters 6 through 10 follow the steps of modeling using regression, path, confirmatory factor, and structural equation models. Next readers find a chapter on reporting SEM research including a checklist to guide decision-making, followed by one on model validation. Chapters 13 through 16 provide examples of various SEM model applications. The book concludes with the matrix approach to SEM using examples from previous chapters. Highlights of the new edition include:  A website with raw data sets for the book's examples and exercises so they can be used with any SEM program, all of the book's exercises, hotlinks to related websites, and answers to all of the exercises for Instructor’s only New troubleshooting tips on how to address the most frequently encountered problems Examples now reference the free student version of Lisrel 8.8 Expanded coverage of advanced models with more on multiple-group, multi-level, \& mixture modeling (Chs. 13 \& 15), second-order and dynamic factor models (Ch. 14), and Monte Carlo methods (Ch. 16) Increased coverage of sample size and power (Ch. 5) and reporting research (Ch. 11) New journal article references help readers better understand published research (Chs. 13 – 17) and 25 \% new exercises with answers to half in the book for student review.

Cronbach’s alpha is regularly adopted in studies in science education: it was referred to in 69 different papers published in 4 leading science education journals in a single year (2015)—usually as a measure of reliability. This article explores how this statistic is used in reporting science education research and what it represents. Authors often cite alpha values with little commentary to explain why they feel this statistic is relevant and seldom interpret the result for readers beyond citing an arbitrary threshold for an acceptable value. Those authors who do offer readers qualitative descriptors interpreting alpha values adopt a diverse and seemingly arbitrary terminology. More seriously, illustrative examples from the science education literature demonstrate that alpha may be acceptable even when there are recognised problems with the scales concerned. Alpha is also sometimes inappropriately used to claim an instrument is unidimensional. It is argued that a high value of alpha offers limited evidence of the reliability of a research instrument, and that indeed a very high value may actually be undesirable when developing a test of scientific knowledge or understanding. Guidance is offered to authors reporting, and readers evaluating, studies that present Cronbach’s alpha statistic as evidence of instrument quality.},

When police activities are neglected or receive negative social perceptions as it occurs in Mexico, it results imperative to explore strategies to overcome the development of illness intrinsically associated to the execution of work activities. This study contributes to the police well-being literature by assessing the appropriateness of using the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) in Mexico. Working on data collected from police officers from northern Mexico, psychometric and statistical analysis were conducted to evaluate (1) the appropriateness of using the MBI on these professionals and (2) levels of burnout and their associations to gender and age. Results support considering the MBI as a valid and reliable tool to evaluate burnout symptoms in Mexican officers. Gender and age did not associate significantly to burnout symptomatology. The use of the MBI is recommended to research and explore burnout symptomatology in Mexican officers as strategy to promote mental health programs.},

Specifically, we specified a structural equation model in order to test the hypotheses that (1) self-rumination predicts spontaneous mind-wandering over and above neuroticism, and (2) self-reflection predicts deliberate mind-wandering over and above need for cognition (i.e., the tendency for an individual to engage in and enjoy thinking). Data were collected on 252 online participants. We found that while the spontaneous and deliberate MW were positively associated with each other, spontaneous MW was uniquely positively predicted by self-rumination, over and above neuroticism, whereas deliberate MW was uniquely positively predicted by self-reflection, over and above need for cognition. These results provide further support for the distinction between the two types of MW and suggest specific motivational dispositions for doing spontaneous and deliberate MW.},

  abstract   = {Cognitive or intellectual investment theories propose that the development of intelligence is partially influenced by personality traits, in particular by so-called investment traits that determine when, where, and how people invest their time and effort in their intellect. This investment, in turn, is thought to contribute to individual differences in cognitive growth and the accumulation of knowledge across the life span. We reviewed the psychological literature and identified 34 trait constructs and corresponding scales that refer to intellectual investment. The dispositional constructs were further classified into 8 related trait categories that span the construct space of intellectual investment. Subsequently, we sought to estimate the association between the identified investment traits and indicators of adult intellect, including measures of crystallized intelligence, academic performance (e.g., grade point average), college entry tests, and acquired knowledge. A meta-analysis of 112 studies with 236 coefficients and an overall sample of 60,097 participants indicated that investment traits were mostly positively associated with adult intellect markers. Meta-analytic coefficients ranged considerably, from 0 to .58, with an average estimate of .30. We concluded that investment traits are overall positively related to adult intellect; the strength of investment-intellect associations differs across trait scales and markers of intellect; and investment traits have a diverse, multifaceted nature. The meta-analysis also identified areas of inquiry that are currently lacking in empirical research. Limitations, implications, and future directions are discussed.},

The present study examined the role of psychological traits in social distancing compliance and mask-wearing behavior and attitude. A sample of 233 U.S. adult residents were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk. Participants completed scales of social distancing compliance, mask-wearing behavior and attitude, need for cognition, self-control, risk attitude, and political ideology. Epidemiological information (seven-day positive rate and the number of cases per 100,000) was obtained based on the state participants resided in. As a result, epidemiological information did not correlate with social distancing compliance mask-wearing. Political ideology, on the other hand, was a significant factor, with a more liberal tendency being associated with greater engagement in social distancing compliance and mask-wearing behavior an attitude. Importantly, those who were more risk averse, or had a higher level of self-control or need for cognition practiced more social distancing and mask-wearing, after controlling for demographics, epidemiological information, and political ideology. Furthermore, for mask-wearing behavior, political ideology interacted with both need for cognition and self-control. Collectively, the study revealed the psychological roots of individual differences in social distancing and mask-wearing compliance.},

Yet, recent evidence also points to beneficial outcomes regarding wellbeing. This review gives an overview of the literature on the role of NFC in wellbeing in adults. Higher NFC was found to be associated with lower neuroticism, higher positive affect and life satisfaction, a more stable identity and higher social confidence, while associations with addictive behaviours and physical health were inconsistent. One mechanism driving these patterns seems to be a higher perceived control in individuals with higher NFC that results in lower depression and burnout via active coping, but also in a reduced effectiveness of health interventions when there was an imbalance between perceived resources and challenges. Thus, this review provides a leverage point for future research on NFC and wellbeing to improve prevention and intervention.

Yet, it remains unclear to what extent these proposed measures provide additional theoretical or empirical utility over established measures of general personality, such as the Big Five. Here, we examine whether character measures display incremental validity over and above the Big Five Inventory and measures of fluid intelligence when predicting academic performance in a large sample (N = 1,583) of 3rd through 8th grade students. The results indicate that multiple character measures demonstrate incremental prediction, particularly need for cognition (ΔR2=6.5\% over personality, ΔR2=2.5\% over personality and fluid intelligence) and school value (ΔR2=4.2\% over personality). Applying regularization techniques to identify a parsimonious solution, both coefficients for need for cognition and school value remained non-zero and accounted for unique variance. The incremental predictive power of individual character measures was primarily due to common variance across the character measures (ΔR2=11.5\% over personality, 9.3\% over personality and fluid intelligence). Educationally-contextualized measures have utility for predicting achievement in addition to decontextualized behavioral and ability measures.},

  abstract   = {Need for Cognition describes relatively stable interindividual differences in cognitive motivation. Previous research has shown relations of Need for Cognition to Self-Control–a capacity that can be broadly defined as resistance to temptation–yet, the processes underlying this relation remain unclear. One explanation for the prediction of Self-Control by Need for Cognition can be an increased motivation to invest cognitive effort with higher levels of Need for Cognition. Another possible link could be that individual differences in the implementation of Self-Control intentions may play a moderating or mediating role for the predictive value of Need for Cognition. Such individual differences in the self-motivated initiation and maintenance of intentions are described by dispositional Action Orientation. Therefore, in the present study, Action Orientation was examined with regard to its possible role in explaining the relation of Need for Cognition to Self-Control. In a sample of 1209 young adults, Self-Control was assessed with two different self-report instruments and moderation and mediation models of the relationship between Need for Cognition, Action Orientation, and Self-Control were tested. While there was no evidence for a moderating role of Action Orientation in explaining the relation of Need for Cognition and Self-Control, Action Orientation was found to partly mediate this relation with a remaining direct effect of Need for Cognition on Self-Control. These results add to the conceptual understanding of Need for Cognition and demonstrate the relevance of trait variables to predict Self-Control.},

In order to facilitate future research, the current study introduces a brief self-report questionnaire that assesses boredom at work, the Dutch Boredom Scale (DUBS). We argue that (1) boredom at work can be distinguished empirically from related concepts such as work engagement and job burnout; (2) boredom at work results from having an unchallenging, “passive” job; and (3) the subsequent lack of challenge in the form of boredom may result in dissatisfaction with the job and with the organization. Using data from 6315 employees, factor analysis supported the factorial and discriminant validity of the DUBS vis-à-vis engagement and burnout. As expected, structural equation modeling revealed that demands and resources were negatively associated with boredom. Moreover, boredom at work was negatively related with job satisfaction and organizational commitment, and positively with turnover intention. These findings support the validity of the DUBS. Future research may focus on underemployment as an antecedent of boredom at work, and on the effects of boredom on job performance.},

The objective of the current study is to analyze the role of professional self-efficacy as a predictor of psychosocial well-being (i.e., burnout and engagement) following the Social Cognitive Theory of Albert Bandura (1997). Structural Equation Modeling was performed in a sample of secondary school teachers (n = 460) and users of Information and Communication Technology (n = 596). Results show empirical support for the predicting role that professional self-efficacy plays in the perception of challenge (i.e., mental overload) and hindrance demands (i.e., role conflict, lack of control, and lack of social support), which are in turn related to burnout (i.e., erosion process) and engagement (i.e., motivational process). Specifically, employees with more professional self-efficacy will perceive more challenge demands and fewer hindrance demands, and this will in turn relate to more engagement and less burnout. A multi-group analysis showed that the research model was invariant across both samples. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.},

Indeed, NFC is positively associated with personality traits pertaining to Positive Emotionality (PE) and negatively to traits related to Negative Emotionality (NE). Moreover, evidence suggests NFC to be related to an active, problem-focused coping style. We therefore hypothesized NFC to mediate between life events and individual differences in PE and NE. In a sample of N = 202 volunteers from the general population, we observed that the number of past positive and negative life events had direct effects on PE, and NE, respectively, and that for positive life events, a mediating effect on PE via NFC was observed, with a higher number of past positive life events being related to higher NFC that in turn was related to increased PE. Thus, the present results lend support to the notion of NFC as an important factor supporting personal well-being by way of its mediating role between the number of past positive life events and positive affect.},

Through an online survey, participants viewed one of four messages: a personalized behavior feedback message, a generic feedback message that contained a memory prompt, a generic feedback message that did not contain a memory prompt, and no message. Pre- and post-intervention measures of specialty coffee drink consumption and participants’ likelihood to reduce their consumption were recorded, and participants’ levels of Need for Cognition were also assessed. Although each of the three behavior feedback messages were successful at encouraging reduced specialty coffee drink consumption compared to the no message control, an interaction effect between Need for Cognition Scale scores and behavior feedback message condition was not established, suggesting that no differences in post-intervention consumption intention were established between individuals of varying levels of Need for Cognition when presented with differing forms of behavior feedback persuasive messages. Furthermore, Need for Cognition predicted both post-intervention specialty coffee consumption intention and likelihood of reducing consumption "in the next few days," but in a surprising manner. Clarification of these results, limitations of the study's methodology, and future research possibilities are also discussed.},

  abstract   = {We examine the controversial practice of using parcels of items as manifest variables in structural equation modeling (SEM) procedures. After detailing arguments pro and con, we conclude that the unconsidered use of parcels is never warranted, while, at the same time, the considered use of parcels cannot be dismissed out of hand. In large part, the decision to parcel or not depends on one's philosophical stance regarding scientific inquiry (e.g., empiricist vs. pragmatist) and the substantive goal of a study (e.g., to understand the structure of a set of items or to examine the nature of a set of constructs). Prior to creating parcels, however, we recommend strongly that investigators acquire a thorough understanding of the nature and dimensionality of the items to be parceled. With this knowledge in hand, various techniques for creating parcels can be utilized to minimize potential pitfalls and to optimize the measurement structure of constructs in SEM procedures. A number of parceling techniques are described, noting their strengths and weaknesses.},
